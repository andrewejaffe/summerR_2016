## In this lab you can use the interactive console to explore 
## 	  but please record your commands here.  
## Remember anything you type here can be "sent" to the console with 
##    Cmd-Enter (OS-X) or Cntr-Enter (Windows/Linux).

# 1. create a new variable called 'my.num' that contains 5 numbers

# 2. mulitply 'my.num' by 3

# 3. create a second variable called 'my.char' that contains 4 character strings

# 4. combine the two variables 'my.num' and 'my.char' into a variable called 'both'

# 5. what is the length of 'both'?

# 6. what class is 'both'?

# 7. divide 'both' by 3, what happens?

# 8. create a vector with elements 1 2 3 4 5 and call it x

# 9. create another vector with elements 10 20 30 40 and call it y

# 10. what happens if you try to add x and y together? why?

# 11. append the value 50 onto the vector y (hint: you can use the c() function)

# 12. add x and y together

# 13. multiply x and y together. pay attention to how R performs operations on vectors of the same length.
