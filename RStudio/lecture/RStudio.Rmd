## RStudio

* "RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R."
* It helps the user use R.
* R, in essence is just the a console that takes commands from you typing into it
* Is NOT dropdown statistical tools (such as Stata)
* Snapshots taken from http://ayeimanol-r.net/2013/04/21/289/

## RStudio/R Console ![Console](r-rstudio-1-3-console.png)

## RStudio/R Console

* Where code is executed (where things happen)
* You can type here for things interactively
* Code is **not saved** on your disk


## Script/Editor ![Script](r-rstudio-1-3-script.png)

## RStudio/R Script/Rmarkdown files

* Where files open to
* Have R code and comments in them
* Can highlight and press (CMD+Enter (Mac) or Ctrl+Enter (Windows)) to run the code
* Code is saved on your disk

## Workspace/Environment ![Workspace](r-rstudio-1-ggplot-point-2.png)

## Workspace/Environment

Workspace/Environment

* Tells you what **objects** are in R
* What exists in memory

History

* Shows previous commands.  Good to look at for debugging, but **don't rely** on it as a script.  Make a script!

## Other Panes

* **Files** - shows the files on your computer of the directory you are working in
* **Viewer** - can view data or R objects
* **Help** - shows help of R commands
* **Plots** - pretty pictures


## Other Panes - packages

* **Packages** - list of R packages that are loaded in memory
    * Packages are a set of functions written by R users
    * We write packages - some are good, some are not so good
* Think of them as "R Extensions"
* If they extend R, when you download R from CRAN, we (and others) refer to things as "base R"
    * We will show you how to do some things in base R, but also show you some newer (and more intuitive) ways to do things
    * You need base R, however, because when you Google for answers, they are commonly answered without any additional packages.

## Hadey Wickham

* Previous Assistant Professor of Statistics at Rice University
* Writes many R packages
* One authority on all things R
* Employee and Developer at RStudio
* I (John) trust almost all his packages
