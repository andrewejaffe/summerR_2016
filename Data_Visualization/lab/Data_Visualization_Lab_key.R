## you will need the charm city circulator dataset:
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)

# read in data
circ = read.csv("http://www.aejaffe.com/winterR_2016/data/Charm_City_Circulator_Ridership.csv", 
           header=TRUE,as.is=TRUE)
# covert dates
circ = mutate(circ, date = mdy(date))
# change colnames for reshaping
colnames(circ) =  colnames(circ) %>% 
  str_replace("Board", ".Board") %>% 
  str_replace("Alight", ".Alight") %>% 
  str_replace("Average", ".Average") 
circ$daily = NULL # remove
# make long
long = gather(circ, "var", "number", 
              starts_with("orange"),
              starts_with("purple"), starts_with("green"),
              starts_with("banner"))
# separate
long = separate_(long, "var", into = c("line", "type"), 
	sep = "[.]")
	
## take just average ridership per day
avg = filter(long, type == "Average")
avg = filter(avg, complete.cases(avg))

# Using ggplot2:

# 1. plot average ridership  by date.
# 	a. Color the points by route (orange, purple, green, banner)
qplot(x = date, y = number, data= avg, colour = line)

#	b. Color the points by day of the week
qplot(x = date, y = number, data= avg, colour = day)
		 
# 2. Replot 1a where the colors of the points are the
#	name of the route (with banner --> blue)
pal = c("blue", "darkgreen","orange","purple")
qplot(x = date, y = number, data= avg, colour = line) +
	  scale_colour_manual(values=pal)

# 3. plot average ridership by date with one panel per route
qplot(x = date, y = number, data= avg, facets = ~line) 
qplot(x = date, y = number, data= avg, facets = ~line,
	colour = line) +  scale_colour_manual(values=pal)
	  
# 4. plot average ridership by date with separate panels
#		by day of the week, colored by route
qplot(x = date, y = number, data= avg, facets = ~day,
	colour = line) +  scale_colour_manual(values=pal)
	  
# Using base R graphics:

# 5. plot average ridership on the orange route versus date
#		as a solid line, and add dashed "error" lines based 
#		on the boardings and alightings. 
#	the line colors should be orange.
orange = filter(long, line=="orange")
orangeList = split(orange, orange$type)
plot(number ~ date, data =orangeList$Average,
	col="orange", type="l", subset= 1:100)
lines(number ~ date, data =orangeList$Alighting,
	col="orange", type="l", lty=2)
lines(number ~ date, data =orangeList$Boarding,
	col="orange", type="l", lty=2)
orange = gather(orange, type, number)
